## Neutral Networks

A repo for work on neutral networks and the adjacent possible.  

A neutral network is a network of point mutations that represents all possible states and pathways in a genetic system. For theoretical purposes, the genetic system is generally quite small, and demonstrates how there can be multiple pathways from one state to the other.

In Figure 1, we can use the vertices of a cube to represent each possible genetic state. Therefore, we have multiple paths from "000" to "111". All of these paths (6) are of equivalent length. One feature of a neutral network is a demonstration of neutrality as equivalent to the [ergodicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodicity) of a network topology. Neutral processes ensure that there are no clearly shorter paths, and selection on the system will tend towards producing asymmetries in the network.
