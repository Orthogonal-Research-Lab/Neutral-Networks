## Neutral Networks

A repo for work on neutral networks and the adjacent possible.  

A neutral network is a network of point mutations that represents all possible states and pathways in a genetic system. For theoretical purposes, the genetic system is generally quite small, and demonstrates how there can be multiple pathways from one state to the other.
